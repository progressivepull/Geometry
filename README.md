# Geometry

# Description 
Geometry is the branch of mathematics that focuses on the properties, relationships, and measurements of shapes, sizes, and spaces. It explores points, lines, angles, surfaces, and solids, helping us understand how objects are positioned and interact in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional spaces.

* **1. Introduction to Geometry** – Basics of points, lines, angles, and planes.

* **Parallel and Perpendicular Lines** – Relationships, slopes, and theorems.

* **Triangles and Their Properties** – Congruence, similarity, and the Pythagorean theorem.

* **Quadrilaterals and Polygons** – Properties and classifications of various shapes.

* **Circles** – Chords, tangents, arcs, circumference, and sector areas.

* **Coordinate Geometry** – Graphing, slope, distance, and midpoint formulas.

* **Transformation**s – Rotations, reflections, translations, and dilations.

* **Three-Dimensional Geometry** – Volume, surface area, and properties of solids.

* **Trigonometry Basics** – Right triangles, sine, cosine, tangent, and applications.
